      <p>
        Founded in 2000, Tracos started as a small family-owned business with a
        vision to transform the heavy equipment industry. What began as a single
        location offering equipment rentals has since grown into a multi-faceted
        company with an expansive fleet, a range of services, and a solid
        reputation built on trust and reliability. Throughout the years,
        we&apos;ve expanded our operations to meet the growing demands of
        industries that rely on efficient and durable machinery. From our humble
        beginnings, we&apos;ve evolved into a leader in providing both sales and
        services for heavy equipment, thanks to our focus on innovation,
        quality, and customer satisfaction. Key milestones in our history
